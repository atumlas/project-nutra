A collection of ideas regarding the overall game.

## General
A birds-eye-view pixel like RPG set in space (or the universe). 

## Mechanics
### Character
* More modern approach -> "You are what you wear" rather than your typical RPG classes approach
### Combat
* Turn based (with a timer?)
* Tile based (Hexagonal looks better IMO)

### Exploration
* Planets, Moons 
   * Static, with procedurally generated instanced "dungeons"
   * Secrets, materials maybe "old" outposts 

### NPCs
* Neutral, Hostile and companions

### Companions
During exploration the player is able to speak to specific NPCs which then join the character and provide additional combat power

### Items
* Equipment
* Consumables

### Crafting
* The player is able to craft items
* Equipment can be upgraded

### Dialogs
