# Ideas
A collection of ideas regarding the overall game.

## General
A birds-eye-view pixel like RPG set in space (or the universe). 

## Story
Something about you being the only human left and your goal is to explore the galaxy to find foes and friends alike.

## Mechanics

### Character 

* More modern approach -> "You are what you wear" rather than your typical RPG classes approach

### Combat
* Turn based (with a timer?)
* Tile based (Hexagonal looks better IMO)

### Exploration
* Planets, Moons 
   * Static, with procedurally generated instanced "dungeons"
   * Secrets, materials maybe "old" outposts
